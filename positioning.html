<p>Search him. Then I will kill you.</p>

<p>Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.</p>

<p>How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death.</p>

<p>Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.</p>

<p>I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.</p>

<p>Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week. Sometimes things just go bad.</p>

<p>When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.</p>

<p>No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an idel and if they can't stop you then you become something else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne.</p>
